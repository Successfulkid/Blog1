        <p>Something excited happened. So I was being dropped off to school one day and I asked my mom for dreads and she said that I can only get them after I finished college. So Then afterwards I asked for waves and she said sure. Waves are a lot of work though.</p>

        <ol>
            <div id="rules"><li> Only brush when hair is moist. One thing to avoid is brushing the hair while it is dry. Only brush when moisturizer has been applied to the waves.</li> <br>
            
           <li>Take vitamins. Taking care of hair goes further than just applying products. A good tip for good healthy hair is to take Biotin vitamins. Multivitamins and Biotin vitamins can be purchased at a local pharmacy. Biotin is known for making hair thicker and healthier.</li> <br>
            
            <li>Get a good brush. A good one to buy is 100% Boar Bristles Diane brush, or another wave brush brand of your choice. Itâ€™s a good idea to have both a hard bristle and a soft bristle brush. Sometimes it takes 6-8 weeks or less for some men to form deep 360 waves</li> <br></div>
            </ol>
